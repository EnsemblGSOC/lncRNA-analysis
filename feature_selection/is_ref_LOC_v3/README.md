#### Logic : <br/>
1) Locus 2 from RefSeq has biotype ncRNA<br/>
2) Locus 2 from RefSeq should must have a value in the Gene symbol field <br/>
from the NCBI Gene website in the format LOC# where # is a number (a <br/>
different format suggests the symbol may be from a publication and we <br/>
would want to investigate further)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) If above statement is True (meaning if there is LOC id for refseq), then save 1. Else save 0.
