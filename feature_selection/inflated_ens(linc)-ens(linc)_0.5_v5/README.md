#### Logic - <br/>
1) "No transcript from locus 1 or 2 is within 500 nucleotides of a second <br/>
lincRNA gene on the SAME strand (opposite stand does not matter)"<br/>
2) If above statement is true, save 1. Else, save 0.<br/>
3) Copy all Ens (lincRNA) genes. Inflate one of them by 500. Now check if they overlap. <br/>
